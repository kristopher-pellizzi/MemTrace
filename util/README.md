# Util

This folder contains a set of secondary script which may be handy for the verification of the overlaps reported by *MemTrace*.

## caller.py

This script requires as parameters the path of the executable that was tested and the path of the considered testcase inside the tracer output folder.
The script will automatically get the command-line arguments and re-execute the same command executed by *MemTrace*.

Example:
Assume we tested */usr/bin/cat*, and the path of the testcase is */home/guest/out/tracer_out/Main/id:000000,time:0,orig:rand*.

The command *caller.py /usr/bin/cat /home/guest/out/tracer_out/Main/id:000000,time:0,orig:rand* will execute *MemTrace* to analyze */usr/bin/cat* using as arguments the ones which can be found in */home/guest/out/tracer_out/Main/id:000000,time:0,orig:rand/args* and using */home/guest/out/tracer_out/Main/id:000000,time:0,orig:rand/input* as the input.



## debug_caller.py

This script is almost identical to *caller.py*, except the **debug enabled** *MemTrace* build will be used, instead of the release build.

The debug enabled build will generate a set of textual files containing information only useful for debugging purposes and, therefore, should never be used, also because it is **much slower** than the release build.



## gdb_caller.py

This script accepts the same positional parameters accepted by *caller.py* and is the most useful one, as it allows to launch the execution of the binary inside *gdb*, still using the arguments and input found in the testcase folder.
By doing so, it is possible for the user, using breakpoints and watchpoints, to **verify** the correctness of the overlaps reported by *MemTrace*.
If the binary accepts input from stdin (instead of an input file), it is **required** to use option *--stdin*.
Note that the script will also define new commands for *gdb* that should make it easier, for the user, to set the required breakpoints.
They are defined in *verification_gdb_session.py* using *gdb python API*(https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Python-API.html).



## count_overlaps.py

This is a quite simple script that, given a textual report generated by *MemTrace*, will simply count the number of reported overlaps (or tables, in case of a merged report).
